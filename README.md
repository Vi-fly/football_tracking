# Soccer Video Analysis System

A comprehensive computer vision system for analyzing soccer videos with advanced tracking, team identification, ball possession analysis, and performance metrics.

## 🚀 Features

### 1. **Multi-Object Tracking**
- **YOLO-based Detection**: Uses YOLO model for detecting players, referees, and the ball

- **Ball Position Interpolation**: Automatically fills missing ball positions using interpolation
- **Position Tracking**: Tracks both center positions and foot positions for different objects

### 2. **Team Assignment System**
- **Color-based Clustering**: Uses K-means clustering to identify team colors from player jerseys
- **Automatic Team Detection**: Automatically assigns players to teams based on jersey colors
- **Visual Team Indicators**: Displays players with team-specific colors (red/blue)

### 3. **Ball Possession Analysis**
- **Player-Ball Assignment**: Determines which player has possession of the ball
- **Distance-based Logic**: Uses proximity analysis to assign ball possession

- **Real-time Updates**: Shows ball control statistics throughout the video

### 4. **Camera Movement Compensation**
- **Optical Flow Analysis**: Detects camera movement using Lucas-Kanade optical flow
- **Feature Point Tracking**: Tracks stable feature points to estimate camera motion
- **Position Adjustment**: Compensates for camera movement in object tracking
- **Movement Visualization**: Displays camera movement metrics on screen

### 5. **View Transformation**
- **Perspective Transformation**: Converts camera view to top-down field view
- **Field Calibration**: Maps pixel coordinates to real-world field dimensions
- **Coordinate System**: Transforms positions to standard soccer field coordinates (68m x 23.32m)

### 6. **Speed and Distance Estimation**
- **Player Speed Calculation**: Calculates player speed in km/h
- **Distance Tracking**: Tracks total distance covered by each player
- **Frame-based Analysis**: Uses sliding window approach for smooth speed calculations
- **Real-time Display**: Shows speed and distance metrics above each player

### 7. **Advanced Visualization**
- **Player Annotations**: Displays player IDs with colored ellipses
- **Ball Tracking**: Shows ball position with triangle markers
- **Team Color Coding**: Different colors for different teams
- **Statistics Overlay**: Real-time display of ball possession and camera movement
- **Performance Metrics**: Speed and distance information for each player

## 🔧 Customization

### Field Calibration
Update the `pixel_vertices` in `view_transformer.py` to match your field dimensions:

```python
self.pixel_vertices = np.array([[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]])
```

### Team Colors
Modify the clustering parameters in `team_assigner.py` for different team color schemes.

### Speed Calculation
Adjust the `frame_window` parameter in `speed_and_distance_estimator.py` for different speed calculation intervals.
